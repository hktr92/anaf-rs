# Roadmap

The project is currently versioned as `0.1.0` and is in its early stages of development. Because of that, the API is subject to change at any time, and it's recommended to use the git-based installation method.

After everything is well-shaped, the 1.0.0 release will happen.

Afterwards, the project will get implementation of other ANAF APIs that were not implemented yet, and the API will be extended to support more features.
