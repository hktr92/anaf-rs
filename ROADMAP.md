# Roadmap

The project is currently versioned as `0.1.0` and is in its early stages of development. Because of that, the API is subject to change at any time, and it's recommended to use the git-based installation method.

After everything is well-shaped, the 1.0.0 release will happen.

Afterwards, the project will get implementation of other ANAF APIs that were not implemented yet, and the API will be extended to support more features.

## pre-v1.0 features:
- bindings for:
    - PHP (ship it as php-ext) -- [ext-php-rs](https://github.com/davidcole1340/ext-php-rs);
    - NodeJS (ship it as native node module) -- [neon](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon);
    - Python (ship it as python module) -- [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3);

## post-v1.0 features:
- ANAF e-Factura API
- ANAF e-Transport API
